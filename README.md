Project_HTML5Benchmark
======================
To set the local server please follow the steps from the below website:
http://www.mobitechie.com/android-2/how-to-access-localhost-on-android-over-wifi/
Download the project and put it on C:\wamp\www
Don' forget to create the database called dataset and load the data from data/dataset.sql
	To create the database :
		use your bowser and tape localhost. 
		Then click on the phpmyadmin. 
		By default the user is "root" and there is no password
		Click on Database
I recommend to use Chrome to benefit all the features that HTML5 propose.
Also some part of the project will need the VPN according to the country where you are (Geolocation and Video).
